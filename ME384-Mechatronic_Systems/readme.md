# Mechatronic Systems - ME384
**Course description:** https://stars.bilkent.edu.tr/syllabus/view/ME/384/20211

**Note 1:** A part of these codes were given by the instructor already in each lab.

**Note 2:** We used very rudimentary types of equipment and operation in these labs. However, the important thing was to write these codes C language and not any Arduino libraries. This includes operations such as port manipulation, interrupts and generating PWM signals.

**Semester :** Year 4 Semester 1
