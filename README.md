# ME-PHYS_Undergraduate_Courses
In this repository I added the codes I used in my projects and homeworks whilst studying at the Bilkent University majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Physics. I did not include the assignments that only require introductory level knowledge and I only included my original solutions, not group work or instructor solution key.

Note: Not all of the codes will be useful as a code, some are just plotting of an already existant dataset. However, they might be useful to some who want to conduct similar experiments and to compare data.
