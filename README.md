# ME-PHYS_Undergraduate_Courses
In this repository I added the codes I used in my projects and homeworks whilst studying at the Bilkent University majoring in **Mechanical Engineering** and minoring in **Physics**. I did not include the assignments that only require introductory level knowledge and I only included **my original solutions**, not group work or instructor solution key.

**Note 1:** Not all of the codes will be useful as a code, some are just plotting of an already existant dataset. However, they might be useful to some who are engaged in similar experiments and want to compare data.

**Note 2:** The quality of the codes tend to be better for the late periods of my curriculum.

**Note 3:** Although some of the projects were "group" projects, usually I did most of the coding and modeling myself, so I did not include any work that I did not do myself entirely.
