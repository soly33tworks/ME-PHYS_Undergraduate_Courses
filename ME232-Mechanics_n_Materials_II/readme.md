# Mechanics and Materials II - ME232
**Course description:** The goal of this course is to provide the students with a working knowledge of the principles of material modeling through theory, experiment and computation. The course content spans fundamental engineering mechanics concepts regarding material behaviour and failure as needed in structural design and analysis, such as thermoelasticity, plasticity, viscoelasticity, fracture and fatigue. In addition to ex- posure to well-accepted theories and practices in these fields, aspects of modern engineering needs and requirements will be highlighted. A fundamental understanding of material behavior and its interaction with structural analysis will be developed as applicable to both engineered materials such as metals and polymers as well as to natural materials such as biological tissue. This course additionally forms a basis for advanced courses on mechanics.
