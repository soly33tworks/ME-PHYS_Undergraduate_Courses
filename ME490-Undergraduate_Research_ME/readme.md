# Undergraduate Research in ME - ME490
**Course description:** https://stars.bilkent.edu.tr/syllabus/view/ME/490/20211?section=1

**Note :** For obvious reasons I used a video that was made public for Project A. However, no public recording existed for Project B, so I cropped out the part that includes sensitive information about it.

**Semester :** Year 4 Semester 2

# Projects

## Project A: Extraction of Positional Data and Wave Behaviour From Microscope Recordings of Buckling Nanomechanical Membranes
