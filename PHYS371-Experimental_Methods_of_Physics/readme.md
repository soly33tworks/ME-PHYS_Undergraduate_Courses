# Experimental Methods of Physics - PHYS374
**Course description:** https://stars.bilkent.edu.tr/syllabus/view/PHYS/374/20212?section=1

**Note:** The codes for almost every lab were only plotting codes for data collected during the lab sessions. Although those sessions were more interesting and related to modern physics, I did not include their code for this reason.

**Semester :** Year 4 Semester 2

# Laboratory Classes

## Lab 1 - Central Limit Theorem Demonstration Using Dice
The code plots the dice roll distribution in real time and prints the final data at the end.
